Letmeask is a Q&A forum built during NLW05, a one week course to practice react. This particular version was focused mostly on builiding a live application ready for production by using Firebase.

You can view the live project [here](https://letmeask-edaae.web.app/)

### :sunglasses: Reasoning behind features

- The project contains an admin screen where the user who created the room can highlight, delete and accept questions. 

- Rules only allow users to delete their own questions and admin over their own rooms and questions.

- Firebase is a great tool for this specific project given that it's really easy to implement real time functionalities and hosting.
