# Letmeask - Thales Kenne

Letmeask is a Q&A forum built during NLW05, a one week course to practice react. This particular version was focused mostly on builiding a live application ready for production by using Firebase.

You can view the live project [here](https://letmeask-edaae.web.app/)

### :cd: Technologies and Features

- Reactjs
- Typescript
- Firebase (Auth, Realtime database, Hosting)
- Functional Components
- Hooks
- Context
- Sass

### :sunglasses: Reasoning behind features

- The project contains an admin screen where the user who created the room can highlight, delete and accept questions. 

- Rules only allow users to delete their own questions and admin over their own rooms and questions.

- Firebase is a great tool for this specific project given that it's really easy to implement real time functionalities and hosting. 

### :exclamation: Known issues

- Given the short time to build, the project is not responsive for mobile screens.

- The feature to answer questions has not been implemented as it's very similar to the question functionality

### :computer: Instructions to run

- Run `yarn` or `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `yarn start` or `npm run start` to start the application on port `:3000`
